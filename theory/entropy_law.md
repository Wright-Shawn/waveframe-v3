# Entropy-Based Expansion Law

## Core Assumption

We adopt the **apparent horizon** as the thermodynamic boundary of the universe. In natural units (ℓₚ = k_B = 1), the entropy is defined as:

\[
S(t) = \frac{\pi}{H(t)^2}
\]

This grounds the model in the holographic principle, making entropy a direct function of the expansion rate.

## Postulate: Constant Entropy Flux

We propose that entropy increases at a **constant rate**:

\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = \gamma
\]

Inserting into the differentiated entropy expression:

\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = -2\pi \cdot \frac{\dot{H}}{H^3} \Rightarrow \dot{H} = -\frac{\gamma H^3}{2\pi}
\]

This yields a **modified expansion law** governed by entropy production alone.

## Solution for H(t)

Solving the ODE:

\[
\frac{dH}{H^3} = -\frac{\gamma}{2\pi} dt
\]

Integrates to:

\[
H(t) = \left( \frac{\pi}{\gamma(t - t_0)} \right)^{1/2}
\]

Here, \( t_0 \) denotes the start of time when \( S(t_0) = 0 \).

## Scale Factor Evolution

We define:

\[
H(t) = \frac{\dot{a}}{a}
\Rightarrow
a(t) = a_0 \cdot \exp\left[ 2 \left( \frac{\pi}{\gamma} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \sqrt{t - t_0} \right]
\]

This growth is faster than a power law, slower than pure de Sitter — a **square-root exponential** expansion.

## Summary

This model:
- Requires **no scalar field**, dark energy, or inflaton
- Embeds thermodynamic growth directly in the expansion
- Derives H(t) and a(t) from **first principles** tied to entropy
