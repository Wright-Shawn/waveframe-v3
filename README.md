# Waveframe 3.0 – Entropy-Driven Cosmology

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16716686.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16716686)

An entropic, information-theoretic cosmological model exploring the evolution of the universe without scalar fields. This framework replaces conventional dynamics with thermodynamic principles and entropy-driven expansion, treating the cosmos as an evolving informational system rather than a fluid governed by classical fields.

## Motivation

Waveframe 3.0 departs from scalar field cosmology by grounding cosmic expansion in entropy growth. The core hypothesis is that spacetime expansion correlates with an increase in the universe's informational entropy—offering a more foundational view that connects thermodynamics, quantum substrates, and emergent spacetime.

## Core Concepts

- Entropy as a Driver: Expansion evolves as a response to entropy production, not as a consequence of dark energy potentials.
- Informational Metrics: Dynamics are expressed in terms of information gradients and thermodynamic analogs.
- No Scalar Fields: The framework intentionally avoids scalar field inflation, quintessence, or modified potentials.
- Emergent Time: Time is treated as an emergent parameter from entropic flow or topological transitions.

## Key Features

- Foundational entropic expansion equations
- Early scaffolding for observable quantities (H(z), μ(z), fσ₈(z))
- Integration pathways for:
  - Discrete time and neural-like substrates
  - Topological rewriting of spacetime structures
  - Information geometric formulations


## Getting Started

To reproduce the early-stage computations or modify the model:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wright-Shawn/waveframe-v3.git
cd waveframe-v3
```

Requirements and instructions will be provided in upcoming releases.
