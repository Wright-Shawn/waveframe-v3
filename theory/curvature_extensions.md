# Spatial Curvature and Anisotropy Extensions

This document explores how the Waveframe entropic cosmology framework generalizes under non-zero spatial curvature and potential anisotropic spacetime configurations.

## 1. Background

So far, we've assumed a flat FLRW metric. But to explore the full parameter space of possible universes, we need to generalize to:

- Curved FLRW models (k = Â±1)
- Bianchi-type metrics (anisotropic but homogeneous)
- Perturbed FLRW metrics (for observational relevance)

---

## 2. Curved FLRW Metric

We use the generalized FLRW line element:

\[
ds^2 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2 \left[ rac{dr^2}{1 - k r^2} + r^2 d\Omega^2 ight]
\]

Where:
- \( k = 0 \): flat
- \( k = +1 \): closed (spherical)
- \( k = -1 \): open (hyperbolic)

### Modified Friedmann Equation

With curvature included, the Friedmann equation becomes:

\[
H(t)^2 + rac{k}{a^2} = rac{1}{3M_{	ext{Pl}}^2} ho
\]

In the entropic model, we replace the RHS with terms derived from entropy-based dynamics.

## 3. Entropy-Driven Curvature Term

Assume entropy still scales with apparent horizon area:

\[
S(t) = rac{\pi}{H(t)^2 + k/a(t)^2}
\]

Now differentiating gives:

\[
rac{dS}{dt} = -2\pi \cdot rac{d}{dt}\left( rac{1}{H^2 + k/a^2} ight)
\]

This leads to modified dynamics that couple entropy evolution to both expansion and curvature.

## 4. Toward Anisotropy: Bianchi I Model

Bianchi I spacetime (diagonal, anisotropic scale factors):

\[
ds^2 = -dt^2 + a_x(t)^2 dx^2 + a_y(t)^2 dy^2 + a_z(t)^2 dz^2
\]

Define average scale factor:

\[
a(t) = (a_x a_y a_z)^{1/3}
\]

Effective Hubble rate:

\[
H(t) = rac{1}{3} \left( rac{\dot{a}_x}{a_x} + rac{\dot{a}_y}{a_y} + rac{\dot{a}_z}{a_z} ight)
\]

Entropy could now be generalized as a function of shear or anisotropic horizon deformations.

## 5. Implications and Use

Adding curvature or anisotropy could:
- Help fit observational anomalies (e.g. CMB low multipoles)
- Break degeneracies in late-time cosmological observables
- Serve as an entropy backreaction mechanism

This generalization broadens the reach of the Waveframe framework and may become essential in matching precise data.
